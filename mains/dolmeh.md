# Dolmeh
Delicious Turkish Appetizer

## Ingredients

- 250 grams grape leaves from a jar or see notes to prepare your own
- 150 grams basmati rice long-grain, 3/4 cup
- 50 grams fresh herbs like parsley, dill, mint, tarragon, chives, washed and finely chopped*
- 1 large yellow onion
- ¼ cup Flavorless oil like canola, vegetable, or sunflower
- salt &amp; pepper to taste
- cumin & turmeric optional, 1/2 tsp each
- ½ cup lemon juice freshly squeezed
- 2 tsp sugar

## Instructions

- Wash the rice 3-5 times in lukewarm water until the water runs clear. Bring a small pot of water to boil, salt the water as you would pasta water, and add the rice. Cook until the rice is al dente, drain, and let it cool slightly. This takes 5-10 minutes. Don’t let the rice get mushy.
- Fry the onion in two tablespoons of oil over medium to medium-high heat until golden. Season with salt and pepper and add the chopped herbs. Cook until wilted, 1-2 minutes. Turn the heat off. Add the rice, 1/4 cup of lemon juice, 1 teaspoon of sugar, and season with salt and pepper. Mix well. Taste, and add seasoning if necessary.
- Remove any remaining stems from vine leaves, and wash. Add hot water and salt and boil for 1-2 minutes until leaves soften slightly. Drain water and allow to cool.
- Add 2 tbsp of oil to the bottom of a small to medium pot and cover it with a layer or two of grape leaves to protect the dolmeh from direct heat.
- Stack two leaves making sure to cover the trimmed stem slot, place 2 tablespoons of the dolmas mixture on top and wrap the leaves tightly around it as you would a burrito. Fold in the two sides, then roll. Repeat until all leaves or the entire mix is used up.
- Pack the dolmeh tightly in the pot lined with grape leaves. You can stack them in layers if using a small pot. If you don’t pack them tightly, they will float in the water, expand, and fall apart.
- Just barely cover the dolmas with water, cover the pot with a lid, and simmer over low heat for about 30 minutes. Add the rest of the lemon juice (1/4 cup) and sugar (1 teaspoon) simmer uncovered for another 5 minutes.
